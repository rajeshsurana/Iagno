Game starts with four discs two for each player already criss-crossed in the center. Black plays first. Each time you have to sandwich one or more lines of your opponent's discs between your own discs. Then sandwiched discs change color and become yours. Then game continues until neither player can legally sandwich any more lines of discs.\r\n\r\nScreenshots of the game in action->\r\n\r\n## 1.
